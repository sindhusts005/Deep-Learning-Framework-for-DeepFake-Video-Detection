# Deep-Learning-Framework-for-DeepFake-Video-Detection
This project presents a deep learning approach for detecting DeepFake videos using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Celeb-DF dataset. The model analyzes facial frames, extracts spatial features, and captures temporal inconsistencies across sequences to accurately identify manipulated content.
